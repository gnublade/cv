Curriculum Vitae
================

This Repository contains my personal CV. It's written in `reStructuredText
<docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ and uses Pandoc_ to convert via xetex
into PDF.

Requirements
============

- Pandoc_
- xetex (see `TeX Live on Ubuntu 12.04`_)
- `Adobe's SourceSans Pro <https://github.com/adobe/Source-Sans-Pro>`_

TeX Live on Ubuntu 12.04
========================

Ubuntu 12.04 comes with a very out of date texlive edition from 2009. 12.10
will introduce the 2012 edition and is available via `backports
<https://launchpad.net/~texlive-backports/+archive/ppa>`_
